Introduction:
_____________________________________
Hi,my name is Adam from Linux Servies.
Me and a few developers have decided
To create a undetected ghost client 
That is cheap and more advanced 
Than most ghost clients with more 
Features, this project has been a 
Idea for 3 months now and production has
Started as of 12/28/22 and should finish
2/17/23 as estimated date, a lifetime 
Key to the menu on launch day will be $5.99
USD,after launch day the final price for a 
Lifetime license key will be $8.99 with sales
Regularly,

What to expect:
_____________________________________

Showing updates and screenshots of
The client and the features it holds,
No code will be uploaded here due to
This client being a private client.
